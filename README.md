- 👋 Hi, let me be unknown for a while. You can refer to me as ai-bhatta until I say my name.
- 👀 I’m interested in pretty much anything that doesn't require programming (jk).
- 🌱 I’m currently an Engineering undergrad in Dubai.
- Also I'm very new to GitHub so still figuring to learn how this works, so far it has been fun. Let's see how it goes in the future😄

- Bbye amigos, take care.
- Thanks for reading till the end😍
