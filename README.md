👋 Heylooo!
- I'm currently in my 2nd year of CSE.
- 🌱 I'm someone really passionate to learn and contribute in the fields of Cyber Security, and Data Science.
- Also I'm very new to GitHub so still figuring to learn how this works, so far it has been fun. Let's see how it goes in the future😄

"I'm a carefree dynamo, busy as can be,
In focus mode, I tackle tasks with glee.
Dancing, coding, writing, and more,
I'm always here to turn you from blue to yellow :D
Who am I? Just give it a shot!!"
------------------------------------------------------
 Bbye amigos, take care.
 Thanks for sticking till the end😍
